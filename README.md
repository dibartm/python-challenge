# python-challenge
This project consists of two parts: 
PyBank and PyPoll
In PyBank, we analyze a CSV file containing financial data, including the total number of months, net profit/loss, and changes in profit/loss over the entire period.
In PyPoll, we analyze a CSV file containing voting data from a small town, including the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election.
